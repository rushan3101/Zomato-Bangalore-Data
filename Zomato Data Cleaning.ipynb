       "[('Rated 4.0', 'RATED\\n  Cilantro had been a descent experience. It had been a community gathering and that the ambience was quite of a descent standard. Lamb Crosstini, Chicken Shahi Korma, Mutton Biriyani (not of a typical South Indian minty taste) and caramel pudding, are few of the delicacies that one must try in there. The overall experience was good. Nice place for a friendly hangout or get together.'), ('Rated 4.0', 'RATED\\n  We took a pool side dinner package from cherishx. The setup is rely nice, considering the cost. The pool was neat and well maintained. The staff were attentive and courteous. The food was slightly a let down. The most of the items were decent, but nothing stood out. The pork chops were quite good, with the right mix of flavours. Some of the starters were lacking in salt. Same goes for the pasta. The cocktail was good and different. Overall decent food and good ambience.')]

       "[('Rated 3.0', 'RATED\\n  This is more like an underground cafe tbh.\\nOnce you get over the weird location, you can actually find some good food here. I vouch for the coffee and sandwiches!\\nQuick Service.\\nValue for money'), ('Rated 3.0', 'RATED\\n  This tiny cozy cafe is hidden underneath Nautees at the commercial street junction. The place is very small and basic, it has a very college \"Adda\" vibe to it. \\n\\nI ordered the regular tea and grill chicken sandwich. The tea was dip tea, which was disappointing. Small cafes like these usually are famous for their chai and coffee. Coming to the sandwich it was regular white bread with lettuce, onion and cheese with some pepper chicken. \\n\\nThis place would do so much better if they just made some fresh chai.

If I need to review the cafe in a neat and prompt way. I'd probably say only the ambiance is the best part of this cafe. D-View cafe is surrounded by green plants and woody furniture, stretching from the facade to the side. Now moving on to food and, staff. It was just an ordinary experience. Though the food quantity and taste was not extra-ordinary, but cannot be shrugged off either. We tried lip-smacking Chicken-lollipop, spicy crispy corn, spinach-corn sandwich and, ordinary mango-chillers. Now the worst part about the cafe is the 'staff'. The staff is absolutely not courteous and very much inattentive. First preference would be given to the cafe people or their relatives! This kinda behavior and the attitude from the staff peeved us off!

       "'[(\\'Rated 4.0\\', \\'RATED\\\\n  A beautiful place to dine in.The interiors take you back to the Mughal era. The lightings are just perfect.We went there on the occasion of Christmas and so they had only limited items available. But the taste and service was not compromised at all.The only complaint is that the breads could have been better.Would surely like to come here again.\\'), (\\'Rated 4.0\\', \\'RATED\\\\n  I was here for dinner with my family on a weekday. The restaurant was completely empty. Ambience is good with some good old hindi music. Seating arrangement are good too. We ordered masala papad, panner and baby corn starters, lemon and corrionder soup, butter roti, olive and chilli paratha. Food was fresh and good, service is good too. Good for family hangout.\\\\nCheers\\'), (\\'Rated 2.0\\', \\'RATED\\\\n  Its a restaurant near to Banashankari BDA. Me along with few of my office friends visited to have buffet but unfortunately they only provide veg buffet. On inquiring they said this place is mostly visited by vegetarians. Anyways we ordered ala carte items which took ages to come. Food was ok ok. Definitely not visiting anymore.\\'), (\\'Rated 4.0\\', \\'RATED\\\\n  We went here on a weekend and one of us had the buffet while two of us took Ala Carte. Firstly the ambience and service of this place is great! The buffet had a lot of items and the good was good. We had a Pumpkin Halwa intm the dessert which was amazing. Must try! The kulchas are great here. Cheers!\\'), (\\'Rated 5.0\\', \\'RATED\\\\n  The best thing about the place is itÃ\\x83\\\\x83Ã\\x82\\\\x83Ã\\x83\\\\x82Ã\\x82\\\\x82Ã\\x83\\\\x83Ã\\x82\\\\x82Ã\\x83\\\\x82Ã\\x82\\\\x92s ambiance. Second best thing was yummy ? food. We try buffet and buffet food was not disappointed us.\\\\nTest ?. ?? ?? ?? ?? ??\\\\nQuality ?. ??????????.\\\\nService: Staff was very professional and friendly.\\\\n\\\\nOverall experience was excellent.\\\\n\\\\nsubirmajumder85.wixsite.com\\'), (\\'Rated 5.0\\', \\'RATED\\\\n  Great food and pleasant ambience. Expensive but Coll place to chill and relax......\\\\n\\\\nService is really very very good and friendly staff...\\\\n\\\\nFood : 5/5\\\\nService : 5/5\\\\nAmbience :5/5\\\\nOverall :5/5\\'), (\\'Rated 4.0\\', \\'RATED\\\\n  Good ambience with tasty food.\\\\nCheese chilli paratha with Bhutta palak methi curry is a good combo.\\\\nLemon Chicken in the starters is a must try item.\\\\nEgg fried rice was also quite tasty.\\\\nIn the mocktails, recommend \"Alice in Junoon\". Do not miss it.\\'), (\\'Rated 4.0\\', \\'RATED\\\\n  You canÃ\\x83\\\\x83Ã\\x82\\\\x83Ã\\x83\\\\x82Ã\\x82\\\\x82Ã\\x83\\\\x83Ã\\x82\\\\x82Ã\\x83\\\\x82Ã\\x82\\\\x92t go wrong with Jalsa. Never been a fan of their buffet and thus always order alacarteÃ\\x83\\\\x83Ã\\x82\\\\x83Ã\\x83\\\\x82Ã\\x82\\\\x82Ã\\x83\\\\x83Ã\\x82\\\\x82Ã\\x83\\\\x82Ã\\x82\\\\x92. Service at times can be on the slower side but food is worth the wait.\\'), (\\'Rated 5.0\\', \\'RATED\\\\n  Overdelighted by the service and food provided at this place. A royal and ethnic atmosphere builds a strong essence of being in India and also the quality and taste of food is truly authentic. I would totally recommend to visit this place once.\\'), (\\'Rated 4.0\\', \\'RATED\\\\n  The place is nice and comfortable. Food wise all jalea outlets maintain a good standard. The soya chaap was a standout dish. Clearly one of trademark dish as per me and a must try.\\\\n\\\\nThe only concern is the parking. It very congested and limited to just 5cars. The basement parking is very steep and makes it cumbersome\\'), (\\'Rated 4.0\\', \\'RATED\\\\n  The place is nice and comfortable. Food wise all jalea outlets maintain a good standard.
